# amongus-bot

**Here is how you can make it work :**

### For The Python coder's and discord bot creators:
> you need these library's : **pyautogui, discord.py, win32api, win32con, opencv-python(cv2), keyboard**
>
> the code is very simple!!, download the AmongUs-BOT.rar and insert your **userid**,**serverid**,**bottoken** into info.txt and run amongus.py.

----------
### For the non python coders :
>>## Keep this in mind : Im am not a professional, so i suggest you go see a youtube video and learn the basics of python or use the help of a friend who knows python.
>
> ### The Easy Part :
>
> First download the AmongUs-BOT.rar file and extract it to any location you want in your pc.
>
> then go into AmongUs-Bot Folder and open up the info.txt file and change "userid" and "serverid" to your user and server id and change bot-token to your bot's token.

>first you need to download python! you can do that by going to microsoft store or <a href=”//www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l”> Click Here </a> (this is python version : 3.8)
>
> After Downloading it from Microsoft Store (or any where else) use **win+r** to open the run window, then type **Powershell** in the run window and **enter**.
>
> now that powershell is open type **python --version** in the powershell and enter. 
> (This will show you the version of python that is installed on your pc, if you used the **hyperlink** above to download python from microsoft store it should show you **python 3.8.x** (x=can change by time))
>
> after checking your python version, you need to install the library's requierd for the bot!
> 
>for doing that, simply use **win+r** again to open the run window. then type **cmd** in the run window and press enter.
>
>now that your **CommandPrompt** is open we are going to install the library's needed for the bot.
>
>first library your going to install is **discord's api** 
>for that, simply copy [**python3 -m pip install -U discord.py**] and paste it in your cmd window and hit enter.
>
>after its finished copy [**pip install pyautogui**] into your cmd window and hit enter.
>
>after thats finished do the same with [**pip install pywin32**]
>
>and the same with [**pip install pypiwin32**]
>
>and the same for [**pip install keyboard**]
>
>and the same for [**pip install opencv-python**]
>
>
> now that the library's are done, we are going to run the bot.
